# BOLT Gym FrontEnd Repo
**Skills :- React, Redux, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS**
- Created a PWA for one of the GYM where I used to go for one month.
- I didn't like the system of writing manually the names on register while entering and 
  leaving gym so  this project solves above problem.
- The app facilitates the gym owner to keep track of daily attendance of users
- Lets him keep track of fees due date, membership renewal, user detials, etc.
- Deployed backend on Heroku, frontend on Netlify and storing database on MongoCloud 
- Currently made only for mobile view keeping in mind the device where this product will be used.
